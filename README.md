# Zoom-and-Kaltura-APIs
Programs for retrieving information about media assets by means of API calls made to Zoom and/or Kaltura.

This repository contains Python programs that retrieve information from Zoom and Kaltura about video files and other assets stored in those systems. These programs were developed in the context of a university at which many faculty and students create video recordings in Zoom, but Kaltura is the platform for long-term storage of videos. The same faculty and students might also create new videos directly on Kaltura. 

The author is not an expert in Python, web programming, Zoom, or Kaltura. The objective of the programs recorded here was to solve practical problems as they arose. The programming style emphasizes readability and maintainability  rather than speed or efficiency of execution.
