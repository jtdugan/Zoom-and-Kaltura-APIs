These programs access Zoom using a JSON Web Token (JWT). The token must be generated by logging in with 
administrative privileges to Marketplace.Zoom.us, creating a JWT App (the name of the App does not matter),
then generating or regenerating the token, specifying an expiration time limit.
The token must be copied from the Marketplace screen, then pasted into the parameters file that is 
read by the program.
