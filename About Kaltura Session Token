These programs access Kaltura using a session token.
To generate a session token, the program first opens a local 
parameters files and reads in an administrative username,
as well as a Kaltura Partner ID and Administrative Secret. The Parter
ID and Administrative secret can be found under Settings > Integration
on the Kaltura Management Console.

With these details, the program can request a session token with a specified
expiration. The token is then used to validate access for all subsequent 
web requests to Kaltura.
